# workshop task
I wanted to make a simulation of a bit of cake growing green mold and strracting little flies (gross!). I thought the walkers kind of looked a lot like creeping mold or moss so i used that code to make the mold appear in varying shades of green. I used little black rectangles to represent the flies - they were originally supposed to be ants but i couldnt really figure out how to make them move like ants so i settled for flies. i had issues trying to get the walkers and the ants to do their own things at the same time. hopefully i will be able to make something a bit more complex later.
